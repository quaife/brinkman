\section{Problem formulation} \label{sc:formulate}
Consider a two-dimensional semi-permeable vesicle suspended in an
unbounded viscous fluid domain, subjected to an imposed flow
$\uu_\infty(\xx)$, for any $\xx \in \RR^2$.  Assume that the interior
and exterior fluids have the same viscosity $\mu$. Let $\xx$ be the
position of the interface $\gamma$, $\uu$ be the fluid velocity, and
$p$ be the pressure. In the vanishing Reynolds number limit, the
governing equations for the ambient fluid are
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eqn:governing}
  -\nabla p + \mu \triangle \uu &= 0, 
  &&\xx \in \RR^2 \setminus \gamma, \\
% 
  \nabla \cdot \uu &= 0,  &&\xx \in \RR^2 \setminus \gamma, \\
%
  \uu(\xx) &\rightarrow \uu_\infty(\xx),
    \qquad &&\norm{\xx} \rightarrow \infty.
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}%
%
Letting $\nn$ be the outward normal to $\gamma$, $\jump{\cdot}$ denote
the jump across the interface, and $T$ denote the hydrodynamic stress
tensor, the boundary conditions along the vesicle are
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:jump1}
  \jump{T\cdot\nn} &= \ff_\mathrm{mem}, \\
  \label{eqn:jump2}
  \jump{\uu} &= 0,
\end{align}
where $\nn$ points outward to the vesicle, and $\ff_\mathrm{mem}$ is the
membrane force that includes a bending term that minimizes the Helfrich
energy, and a tension term that acts as a Lagrange multiplier to satisfy
the local inextensibility condition. The bending stiffness only sets the
time scale, so we let $k_b = 1$ throughout the paper. For ease of
implementation, we modify the bending tension and forces as
$\ff_\mathrm{mem} = \ff_\mathrm{ben} + \ff_\mathrm{ten}$, where
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:membraneForces}
  \ff_\mathrm{ben} = -\xx_{ssss}, \qquad
  \ff_\mathrm{ten} = (\sigma \xx_s)_s.
\end{align}
However, the physical tension $\Lambda$ can be computed as a
post-processing step as
\begin{align}
  \Lambda = \sigma + 1.5 \kappa^2,
\end{align}
where $\kappa$ is the membrane curvature.

The kinematic condition is modified to account for the fact that the
fluid can move through the membrane. A standard choice appears
is~\cite{}
\begin{align}
  \uu - \dot{\xx} = - \beta (\ff_\mathrm{mem} \cdot \nn) \nn, \qquad
  \xx \in \gamma,
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is a semi-permeability rate.  

Reduced area is $\nu = 4\pi A/L^2$.


\subsection{Integral equation formulation}
Since the flow is governed by the linear Stokes equations, it can be
represented in terms of layer potentials. Given the boundary
conditions~\eqref{eqn:jump1} and~\eqref{eqn:jump2} required on the
interface, the fluid velocity can be represented as the single-layer
potential
\begin{align}
  \uu(\xx) = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \SS[\ff_\mathrm{mem}](\xx), \quad
    \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \SS[\ff](\xx) = \frac{1}{4\pi\mu} \int_{\gamma} \left(
    -\mathbf{I} \log\rho + \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} \right)
    \ff(\yy) ds_{\yy},
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$ and $\rho = \norm{\rr}$. Then, by the
kinematic equation, the dynamics of the vesicle 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:vesVelocity}
  \frac{d\xx}{dt} = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \beta (\ff_\mathrm{mem}\cdot\nn)\nn
  + \SS [\ff_\mathrm{mem}](\xx).
\end{align}
Finally, the inextensibility condition is given by
\begin{align}
  \xx_s\cdot\dot{\xx}_s = 0.
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Area Dynamics}
Following the analysis of Veerapaneni et al.~\cite{vee-raj-bir-pur2009},
we compute the steady-state shape of a semi-permeable vesicle in a
quiescent flow. The steady-state shape is a stationary point of the
Lagrangian
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma} \kappa^2 \, ds +
    \Lambda \left(\int_{\gamma} ds  - L \right),
\end{align}
where $\Lambda$ is the constant tension that acts as a Lagrange
multiplier to satisfy the length conservation. Note that there is no
pressure Lagrange multiplier since the vesicle's area fluctuates. The
force acing on the membrane is found by taking the variation of
$\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $\gamma$, and by setting the total force
to zero, the steady state shape satisfies
\begin{align}
  \kappa_{ss} + \frac{1}{2}\kappa^3 - \Lambda \kappa = 0.
  \label{eqn:curvODE}
\end{align}
with initial conditions $\kappa(0) = \kappa_0$ and $\kappa_s(0) = 0$.
Integrating the differential equation~\eqref{eqn:curvODE} with respect
to arclength, we have
\begin{align}
  \frac{\kappa_s^2}{2} + \frac{\kappa^4}{8} - 
    \frac{\Lambda}{2}\kappa^2 = \kappa_0^4 - \frac{\Lambda}{2}\kappa_0^2.
  \label{eqn:curvODE2}
\end{align}
Assuming $\kappa_s \neq 0$, this differential equation is separable, and
can be solved analytically using Mathematica. For impermeable vesicles,
it is possible for the curvature to be
periodic~\cite{vee-raj-bir-pur2009}. However, the solution
of~\eqref{eqn:curvODE2} depends on the {\em EllipticF} function, and it
can not be made periodic. Therefore, the only solution
of~\eqref{eqn:curvODE2} is $\kappa(s) = \kappa_0$, meaning that the
steady state shape is a circle. By the inextensibility condition, the
steady state vesicle has a radius of $L/2\pi$, so its curvature and
tension are
\begin{align}
  \kappa = \frac{2\pi}{L}, \: \Lambda = \frac{2\pi^2}{L^2}.
  \label{eqn:SSshape}
\end{align}
Note that in contrast to a impermeable vesicle, the final tension is
positive rather than negative.

In addition to computing the steady shape, we can compute the transient
area of the vesicle. Parameterizing the vesicle with $\xx$, its area is
\begin{align}
  A(t) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma} (\xx \cdot \nn)\, ds .
  \label{eqn:area}
\end{align}
The derivative of $A(t)$ includes terms due to the time derivative of
$\xx \cdot \nn$, and a term due to interface
stretching~\cite{lai-tse-hua2008}. However, the stretching term is zero
because of the local inextensibility condition. Therefore,
\begin{align}
  \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{\gamma} \pderiv{}{t} 
    (\xx \cdot \nn) \, ds = 
  \frac{1}{2} \int_{\gamma} (\dot{\xx} \cdot \nn)\, ds  + 
  \frac{1}{2} \int_{\gamma} (\xx \cdot \dot{\nn})\, ds.
\end{align}
The second integrand can be computed as
\begin{align}
  \int_\gamma (\xx \cdot \dot{\nn})\, ds 
    = \int_\gamma \left(\xx \cdot \dot{\xx}_s^\perp \right)
    = -\int_\gamma \left(\xx^\perp \cdot \dot{\xx}_s\right)\, ds 
    = \int_\gamma \left(\xx_s^\perp \cdot \dot{\xx}\right)\, ds 
    = \int_\gamma (\dot{\xx} \cdot \nn)\, ds.
\end{align}
Therefore,
\begin{align}
  \dot{A}(t) &= \int_\gamma (\dot{\xx} \cdot \nn)\, ds 
  = \int_\gamma \left(\beta (\ff \cdot \nn)\nn + \SS[\ff]\right) 
      \cdot \nn\, ds 
  = \beta \int_\gamma (\ff \cdot \nn)\, ds,
\end{align}
where the last equality follows from the incompressibility of the
single-layer potential and the divergence theorem.  Using integration by
parts and the Frenet-Serret identities, we have
\begin{align}
  \dot{A}(t) &= \beta \int_\gamma \left( -\xx_{ssss} + 
    (\sigma \xx_s)_s \right) \cdot \nn \, ds \\
  &= -\beta \int_\gamma \left(-\xx_{sss} + \sigma \xx_s 
    \right) \cdot \kappa \xx_s \, ds \\
  &= -\beta \int_\gamma \left(\xx_{ss} \cdot 
    (\kappa \xx_s)_s + \kappa \sigma \right) \, ds \\
  &= -\beta \int_\gamma \left(\kappa (\xx_{ss} \cdot \xx_{ss}) + 
    \kappa_s (\xx_{ss} \cdot \xx_s) + \kappa \sigma \right) 
    \, ds \\
  &= -\beta \int_\gamma \left(\kappa^3 + \kappa \sigma \right) 
    \, ds.
\end{align}
Finally, using the relationship between the Lagrange multiplier
$\sigma$, and the tension $\Lambda$, the area of a semi-permeable
vesicle is governed by
\begin{align}
  \dot{A}(t) = \beta \int_\gamma \left(
    \frac{\kappa^3}{2} - \kappa \Lambda \right) \, ds.
  \label{eqn:areaROC}
\end{align}
Note that this is consistent with the steady state curvature and
tension~\eqref{eqn:SSshape} since these constant values result in the
integrand in equation~\eqref{eqn:areaROC} being zero.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numerical Methods}
\subsection{Discretization in Space}
We apply a collocation method where the vesicle is discretized at $N$
points. We need to compute derivatives of functions defined on the
vesicle boundary, and these are done with Fourier differentiation.
Finally, to compute the single-layer potential, we use an eighth-order
Alpert quadrature rule~\cite{alp1999} which resolves the logarithmic
singularity of the integrand.

\subsection{Discretization in Time}
By using an integral equation formulation, the only unknowns are the
vesicle position and tension, and the flow in the bulk does not have to
be computed. However, the high-order derivatives in the bending and
tension forces~\eqref{eqn:membraneForces} result in stiffness if an
explicit time stepping method is applied to
equation~\eqref{eqn:vesVelocity}. We apply a similar semi-implicit time
stepping method to our previous works~\cite{vee-gue-zor-bir2009,
qua-bir2014}. First, given a vesicle $\gamma$, with a boundary
parameterized as $\xx(s)$, we introduce notation for all the required
differential and projection operators
\begin{align}
  B[\xx]\ff &= -\frac{d^4}{ds^4} \ff, \\
  T[\xx]\sigma &= (\sigma \xx_s)_s, \\
  D[\xx]\ff &= \xx_s \cdot \ff_s, \\
  P[\xx]\ff &= (\ff \cdot \nn) \nn. 
\end{align}
Here, the normal vector $\nn$ is the outward unit normal of $\gamma$,
and $d/ds$ is its arclength derivative. To simplify notation, we write
$B\ff$ to mean $B[\xx]\ff$, and use similar notation for the other
operators. Then, the dynamics of the vesicle are governed by
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\xx}{dt} &= \uu_{\infty}(\xx) + 
  \beta P(B\xx + T\sigma) + \SS(B\xx + T\sigma), \\
  D \frac{d\xx}{dt} &= 0.
\end{align}
By writing $B^N$ to mean the bending operator due to the vesicle
configuration at time $t^N$, and similar notation for the other
operators, we address the stiffness by introducing the semi-implicit
time stepping method
\begin{align}  
  \frac{\xx^{N+1} - \xx^N}{\Delta t} = \uu_\infty(\xx^N) 
  + \beta P^N\left(B^N\xx^{N+1} + T^N\sigma^{N+1}\right) 
  + \SS^N\left(B^N\xx^{N+1} + T^N\sigma^{N+1}\right).
\end{align}
Finally, the inextensibility condition is applied by requiring that 
\begin{align}
  D^N\xx^{N+1} = 1.
\end{align}

\section{Examples}
We consider a single semi-permeable vesicle in four different flow
regimes. All vesicles have a length of $L=4\pi$, but the area is not
conserved because of semi-permeability. However, the area is bounded by
$4\pi$ which is the area of a circle with length $L=4\pi$. For each
simulation, we apply an SDC second-order adaptive time stepping
method~\cite{qua-bir2016}. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quiescent Flow} 
We consider a semi-permeable vesicle with initial reduced area $0.65$
and several different permeability rates $\beta$ in a quiescent flow. If
the vesicle is impermeable, meaning that $\beta = 0$, it will relax to a
steady-state shape with negative and constant
tension~\cite{kra-win-sei-lip1996}. However, from
equation~\eqref{eqn:SSshape}, a semipermeable vesicle relaxes to a
circle with positive constant tension. Since the area of a
semi-permeable vesicle is governed by~\eqref{eqn:areaROC}, we expect
that the time for the vesicle to deviate from its initial area, and the
time to reach the steady state will both scale with $\beta^{-1}$. In
Figure~\ref{fig:ellipseArea}, we plot the area of a vesicle with
different permeability rates. The area is computed directly from the
vesicle shape (solid lines) and by integrating
equation~\eqref{eqn:areaROC} (marks) with a first-order method. We also
include black dashed lines indicating the times, $t_{\mathrm{steady}}$,
that the vesicle is near its steady state circular shape. In
Table~\ref{tbl:ellipseRelaxTimes}, we report the time,
$t_\mathrm{steady}$, required for the vesicle's area to be within 1.3\%
of its maximum area, and the time, $t_\mathrm{inflate}$, required for
the vesicle's area to exceed 1.3\% of its initial area. We see that both
times scale with $\beta^{-1}$.

  equation~\eqref{eqn:areaROC}. The dashed black lines are the times
  when the vesicle's area is within 1.3\% of its maximum value of
  $4\pi$.}
\end{figure}

We further analyze the transient dynamics for small $\beta$ by
considering the vesicle velocity~\eqref{eqn:vesVelocity} due to
semi-permeability, $\beta(\ff \cdot \nn)\nn$, and force balance,
$\SS[\ff]$. Initially, since $\beta$ is small, the semi-permeability velocity is much
smaller than the balance velocity. Therefore,
the velocity resembles that of an impermeable vesicle. However, as the
vesicle approaches the steady state shape of an impermeable vesicle, the
force balance velocity decreases below the semi-permeability velocity,
at which point the semi-permeable vesicle begins to inflate.  Finally,
the vesicle semi-permeable inflates until it is circular with zero
membrane force, and therefore zero velocity.  Letting $\beta = 10^{-3}$,
in Figure~\ref{fig:vesVelocity} we plot the force balance velocity
(blue) and the semi-permeability velocity (red) at three times. We also
plot the velocity of an identically initialized impermeable vesicle
(green). At $t=0.5$, semi-permeability velocity is small relative to the
force balance velocity, and the semi-permeable velocity matches with the
impermeable vesicle velocity. At time $t=5$, the velocity of the
impermeable vesicle, and also the force balance velocity, are comparable
in size to the semi-permeability velocity, and the semi-permeable
vesicle begins to inflate. Then, at time $t=50$, the impermeable vesicle
is at its steady state, while the semi-permeable vesicle still has
contributions due to semi-permeability and force balance. In
Figure~\ref{fig:vesVelocityNorm}, we plot the maximum norm of the
different velocity contributions as a function of time. The black
vertical lines correspond to the times reported in
Figure~\ref{fig:vesVelocity}. Again, we see that the velocity of a
semi-permeable vesicle initially agrees with the velocity of an
impermeable vesicle. Then, as the force balance velocity approaches
zero, the semi-permeable velocity becomes significant, causing the
vesicle to inflate until it reaches a steady state circular shape.

  correspond to the times reported in Figure~\ref{fig:vesVelocity}.}
\end{figure}

Finally, we consider a semi-permeable vesicle, with $\beta=1$, that
initially has regions with positive curvature and others with negative
curvature. The vesicle shape at several time steps is in
Figure~\ref{fig:starShape}, and, as we have shown, the steady state
shape is circular.  We also compute the tension, $\Lambda$, and the
flux, $\ff \cdot \nn$, and plot the results in
Figure~\ref{fig:starTensionFlux}. The vesicle undergoes three general
behaviors: (i) For $t \in (0,1.6 \times 10^{-2})$, the vesicle has a net
negative flux resulting in a loss of area; (ii) For $t \in (1.6 \times
10^{-2},1.0)$, the vesicle has a net positive flux and the tension most
of the membrane is undergoing negative tension; (iii) For $t \in
(1.0,2.0)$, the vesicle is near its steady state and transitions to a
positive constant tension. In the first time interval, the vesicle
deflates. Near the points of largest negative curvature, there is a
large negative tension and large inflow (positive flux).
Correspondingly, near the points with largest positive curvature, there
is a small tension and outflow (negative flux). In the second time
interval, the tension is negative and the flux is positive nearly
everywhere. The regions with largest negative curvature correspond to
regions with largest negative tension and the most inflow. Finally, in
the last time interval, the tension transitions to a positive constant
function, the membrane force and flux transition to zero, resulting in a
steady state circular vesicle with positive constant tension.

\subsection{Shear Flow}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mild dependence on initial shape

  \item Look at tank-treading angle, tank-trading speed, reduced area,
    absolute value of the permeable flux

  \item Max flux at the steady state as a function of beta and
    $\dot{\gamma}$

  \item reduced area/inclination angle for a particular $(\beta,\gamma)$
    and different flux rates using the gating functions (Apr 7 and 9) as
    well as constant $\beta$
\end{itemize}

We consider a semi-permeable vesicle in the shear flow
$\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot{\gamma} (y,0)$ with different permeability
rates $\beta$ and shear rates $\dot{\gamma}$.  For a two-dimensional
impermeable vesicle, depending on the reduced area and viscosity
contrast, vesicles in a shear flow either tank tread or
tumble~\cite{fin-lam-sei-gom2008,kra-win-sei-lip1996}, but tumbling is
not possible with viscosity contrast of one. Since we are considering
semi-permeable vesicles, we assume that there is no viscosity contrast,
and we do not expect to observe tumbling dynamics.

We initialize an elliptical vesicle with reduced area $\nu = 0.65$, and
with its long axis oriented in the $y$-direction. For all permeability
rates and shear rates, the semi-permeable vesicle tilts to an
inclination angle and undergoes tank-treading behavior. However, because
of the semi-permeability, the final reduced area does not agree with the
initial reduced area. In Figure~\ref{fig:shearPhase}, we plot the final
shape of the vesicle for various permeability rates, $\beta$, and shear
rates $\dot{\gamma}$. We also includes lines of constant final reduced
area. We see that the shear rate has the largest effect on the final
reduced area. However, for small $\beta$, the permeability rate also has
a large effect on the final reduced area. In particular, the smallest
final reduced areas are the result of large shear rates and small
permeability rates.

%\section{{$\Theta-L$} formulation}
%Here, we attempt to apply the formulation described by Sohn et
%al.~\cite{soh-tse-li-voi-low2010} to a semi-permeable vesicle.  In the
%semi-permeable formulation, the vesicle velocity is
%\begin{align}
%  \pderiv{\XX}{t} = \uu(\XX(t)) + \beta (\ff \cdot \nn) \nn.
%\end{align}
%In the {$\Theta-L$} variables, we require a normal velocity $V$, and a
%tangential velocity $T$. Since the inextensibility condition is $T_s +
%\kappa V = 0$, a condition for the vesicle velocity is
%\begin{align}
%  (\uu \cdot \ss)_s = -\kappa(\beta (\ff \cdot \nn) +

%\end{align}
%This equation can be solved following equations (32)--(39)

%\begin{align}

%\section{Area of a Vesicle}
%The area inside a single vesicle $\gamma$ parameterized with $\xx$ is
%\begin{align}
%  A(t) = \int_{\gamma} (\xx \cdot \nn)\, ds = 
%    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\xx \cdot \pderiv{\xx}{\theta}^\perp\right)
%    \, d\theta.
%\end{align}
%Taking the time derivative of $A(t)$,
%\begin{align}
%  \dot{A}(t) &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(
%    \dot{\xx} \cdot \pderiv{\xx}{\theta}^{\perp} + 
%    \xx \cdot \pderiv{\dot{\xx}}{\theta}^{\perp}\right) \\
%    \, d\theta.
%  &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(
%    (\dot{\xx} \cdot \nn)\|\xx'(\theta)\| \right) d\theta +
%     \int_{0}^{2\pi}
%    \xx \cdot \frac{d}{dt}\left(\nn |\frac{d\xx}{d\theta}| \right)
%\end{align}
%
%
%
%\begin{align}
%  A(t) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma} (\xx \cdot \nn)\, ds = 
%    \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\xx \cdot \pderiv{\xx}{\theta}^\perp\right)
%    \, d\theta.
%\end{align}
%Taking the time derivative of $A(t)$,
%\begin{align}
%  \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\dot{\xx} \cdot
%  \pderiv{\xx}{\theta}^{\perp} + 
%    \xx \cdot \pderiv{\dot{\xx}}{\theta}^{\perp}\right) d\theta, \\
%  &= \frac{1}{2}
%  \int_{0}^{2\pi}(\dot{\xx}\cdot\nn)\left\|\pderiv{\xx}{\theta}\right\|d\theta +
%     \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}
%    \left(\xx \cdot \pderiv{\dot{\xx}}{\theta}^{\perp}\right)d\theta, \\
%  &= \frac{\beta}{2} \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds +
%  \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\left(\xx \cdot \pderiv{}{t}\left(\nn
%  \left\|\pderiv{\xx}{\theta}\right\|\right)\right)d\theta, \\
%  &= \frac{\beta}{2} \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds + \frac{1}{2}
%  \int_{\gamma}\left(\xx\cdot\dot{\nn}\right)ds + \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}
%  \frac{\xx\cdot\nn}{\left\|\pderiv{\xx}{\theta}\right\|}
%  \left(\pderiv{\xx}{\theta}\cdot
%  \pderiv{\dot{\xx}}{\theta}\right)d\theta \\
%  &= \frac{\beta}{2} \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds + \frac{1}{2}
%  \int_{\gamma}\left(\xx\cdot\dot{\nn}\right)ds + \frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma}
%  (\xx\cdot\nn) (\xx_s \cdot \dot{\xx}_s)\, ds.
%\end{align}
%To satisfy the inextensibilty condition, $\xx_s \cdot \dot{\xx}_s = 0$.
%Therefore the time derivative of $A(t)$ is
%\begin{align}
%     \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{\beta}{2} \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds
%     + \frac{1}{2} \int_{\gamma}\left(\xx\cdot\dot{\nn}\right)ds.
%\end{align}
%which we re-write as
%\begin{align}
%    \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{\beta}{2}
%    \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma}\left(\xx^{\perp}\cdot\dot{\xx}_s\right) ds.
%\end{align}
%Applying integration by parts,
%\begin{align}
%    \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{\beta}{2}
%    \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds+\frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma}\left(\xx^{\perp}_s\cdot\dot{\xx}\right) ds,
%\end{align}
%which we re-write as
%\begin{align}
%    \dot{A}(t) &= \frac{\beta}{2}
%    \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds+\frac{1}{2}\int_{\gamma}\left(\dot{\xx}\cdot\nn\right),\\
%    \dot{A}(t) &= \beta \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds.
%\end{align}
%
%
%At steady state,
%\begin{align}
%    \dot{A}(t) &= \beta \int_{\gamma}\left(\ff\cdot\nn\right)ds =0.
%\end{align}
%We now replace $\ff$ with its definition and apply integration by parts
%\begin{align}
%   0=\beta\int_{\gamma} 
%    (-k_b\xx_{ssss}+(\sigma\xx_s)_s)\cdot\nn\, ds =
%   \beta\int_{\gamma}\left(k_b\xx_{sss}-\sigma\xx_s\right)\cdot
%     \nn_s\, ds
%\end{align}
%From the Frenet-Serret formulas, we have 
%\begin{align}
%     -\beta\int_{\gamma}
%     \left(k_b\xx_{sss}-\sigma\xx_s\right)\cdot\kappa\xx_s ds &=0.
%\end{align}
%
%Applying integration by parts and Frenet-Serret again
%\begin{align}
%     \beta\int_{\gamma}
%     k_b\kappa\left(\xx_{ss}\cdot\xx_{ss}\right)ds + \beta
%     \int_{\gamma} k_b \kappa_s(\xx_{ss} \cdot \xx_s)ds +\beta\int_{\gamma}\kappa\sigma ds  &= 0,\\
%    \beta\int_{\gamma} k_b\kappa(\kappa\nn \cdot
%     \kappa\nn)+ \beta \int_{\gamma} k_b \kappa_s(\xx_{ss} \cdot
%     \xx_s)ds +\beta\int_{\gamma}\kappa\sigma ds &= 0,
%\end{align}
%which we re-write as
%\begin{align}
%   \beta\int_{\gamma}k_b\kappa^3 ds + \beta \int_{\gamma} k_b
%   \kappa_s(\xx_{ss} \cdot \xx_s)ds +\beta\int_{\gamma} \kappa\sigma ds = 0.
%\end{align}
%Applying Frenet-serret again,
%\begin{align}
%    \beta\int_{\gamma}k_b\kappa^3 ds + \beta \int_{\gamma} k_b
%    \kappa_s(\kappa\nn \cdot \TT)ds +\beta\int_{\gamma} \kappa\sigma ds = 0, \\
%    \beta\int_{\gamma}k_b\kappa^3 ds +\beta\int_{\gamma} \kappa\sigma ds  = 0.
%\end{align}

%\section{Including a concentration field}
%Based on the work of Yao and Mori~\cite{yao-mor2017}, we introduce a
%chemical concentration field $c$.  The concentration field is governed
%by the advection-diffusion equation
%\begin{align}
%  \pderiv{c}{t} + \nabla \cdot (\uu c) = D\Delta c.
%\end{align}
%If the concentration is diffusion dominated (zero Peclet number), then
%the concentration satisfies
%\begin{align}
%  \Delta c = 0, \quad \xx \in \RR^2.
%\end{align}
%The boundary conditions of the concentration field on the vesicle
%$\gamma$ are
%\begin{align}
%  (\uu c - D\nabla c) \cdot \nn = c \pderiv{\xx}{t} \cdot \nn + 
%    j_c + j_p,
%\end{align}
%where $j_c$ and $j_p$ are the transmembrane chemical flux due to passive
%transport and active transport (pumps), respectively.  In the zero
%Peclet number limit, the absence of an active transport mechanism, and
%the choice for the passive flux, the boundary condition of the
%concentration field is
%\begin{align}
%  -D\pderiv{c}{\nn} = c \pderiv{\xx}{t} + 
%    k_c \jump{c}, \quad \xx \in \gamma.
%\end{align}
%To couple the vesicle dynamics to the concentration, there is a
%difference between the fluid velocity and vesicle velocity
%\begin{align}
%  \uu - \pderiv{\xx}{t} = j_w \nn,
%\end{align}
%where $j_w$ is the water flux through the vesicle.  This is the
%osmophoretic flow.  In~\cite{yao-mor2017}, this flux is
%\begin{align}
%  j_w = -k_w(RT\jump{c} + \ff_\text{mem} \cdot \nn).
%\end{align}
%In our current implementation, we drop the $RT\jump{c}$ term, and
%let $\beta = k_w$.

%When the semi-permeable vesicle reaches a steady-state shape, we have
%\begin{align}
%  \int_{\gamma} \left(-\frac{\kappa^3}{2} + \kappa \Lambda \right) \, ds
%  = 0.
%\end{align}
%Based on numerical observations, the steady-state shape is a circular
%vesicle with constant tension. Since the tension and curvature are
%constant, we can solve for the curvature in terms of the tension $\kappa
%= \sqrt{2\Lambda}$. Therefore, the steady state shape is a circle of
%radius $r = 1/\sqrt{2\Lambda}$, and therefore the length is
%\begin{align}
%  L = \frac{\sqrt{2}\pi}{\sqrt{\Lambda}},
%\end{align}
%which is constant by the local inextensibility constraint. Finally, we
%can compute the final tension in terms of the length using the formula
%\begin{align}
%  \Lambda = \frac{2\pi^2}{L^2}.
%\end{align}
%Therefore, in contrast to a impermeable vesicle, the final tension is
%positive rather than negative.
%
%We start by simulating a star-shaped vesicle in a quiescent flow with
%semi-permeability rate $\beta=1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:starShape}). To
%perform this simulation, we use an adaptive second-order time stepping
%method~\cite{qua-bir2016}. The times and reduced areas are in the
%titles, and note that the shapes are not eqiuspaced in time.
